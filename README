This is the developers kit for a PC/SC driver for Unix and Mac OS X.
Please refer to the documentation in PDF format in the docs directory
for a complete guide to creating your own driver.

This package has been modified to use librfid as to create an completely free and open source driver for the rc632 based Omnikey 5321 and 6321.

1. get the svn version of librfid from

http://openmrtd.org/projects/librfid/

svn co https://svn.gnumonks.org/trunk/librfid

2. Apply the patch to the librfid sources

patch -p0 < librfid_pcsc.patch

3. build librfid

./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-ccid
make
make install (as root)

optionally test, if librfid is working by changing into the utils directory and executing, when the hardware is connected and a iso14443a card is in the field
./librfid-send_script script
where script is a text file containing apdus

4. build the ifd handler by just runnning
make

5. configure your pcscd to use the generated library by adding the following lines to readers.conf

FRIENDLYNAME     "librfid"
DEVICENAME       /dev/null
LIBPATH          /PATH_TO_GENERATED_IFD_HANDLER/libgen_ifd_librfid.so
CHANNELID        0x000001

6. connect the hardware and restart pcscd, there should now be a reader available.

stopping pcscd will hang, so it has to be killed manually!
killall pcscd -9
this is due to the patch to librfid, which disbles a return by timeout from an interrupt handling routine. unfortunately this return inhibits the normal receiving action and had to be disabled. a clean solution would be much appreciated.
